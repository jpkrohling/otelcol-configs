# üçö Contributing your recipes

Do you have a cool recipe to contribute? That's great! Here's what I look for when reviewing a contribution:

- Keep a narrow focus and demonstrate one concept or integration
- The recipe has to be reproducible for everyone
- Specify the versions of the software you used for testing the recipe
- It should be self-contained. It might reference other recipes, but everything needed to succeed is included in the recipe itself
- Unless you are demonstrating a specific exporter, export the telemetry to Grafana Cloud for consistency with the other recipes
- Recipes featuring other commercial vendors are OK as long as they can be reproduced by everyone with a free account. If the main purpose of the recipe is to show how to export data to this vendor, propose one that is similar to [`grafana-cloud`](./grafana-cloud/)
